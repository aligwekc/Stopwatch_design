# Stopwatch_design
In this project, I designed a stopwatch. The stopwatch is able count from 0 milliseconds to 24 hours. I made use of all the seven segments BCD display on the Nexys 4 DDR board. The user is able to start the stopwatch by flipping the start switch which is the first switch on the board and the user is also able to stop the timer from running by flipping the start switch which stops it. The user is also able to reset the stopwatch by flipping the second switch on while the start switch is off, this resets the current numbers displayed on the seven segment to zero. 
The design is set up in such a way that each BCD display is initialised with an integer range, when a BCD display reaches its integer range it rolls over to the next BCD and begins to count again from zero. This process continues until the stopwatch reaches 24 hours or the user stops it from running. When each switch is turned on, the LED light also comes on and when the switch is turned off, the LED light goes off.. It is a way of indicating to the user which switch was turned on or off.
